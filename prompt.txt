You are my codebase analyst. I want you to scan the entire repo and generate a clear, structured summary of the codebase. This summary should cover:

- Project structure (folders, files, layers)
- Key technologies, frameworks, and libraries
- Major modules and their responsibilities
- Important functions, hooks, and utilities
- Database models / schemas / migrations
- API routes and how they connect to frontend
- Common patterns or conventions (naming, architecture, state management, etc.)
- Any repeated logic that should be abstracted

Format it in a way that is easy to reference later, like a living architecture doc.

Whenever I ask you again, update this summary based on new code changes instead of rewriting from scratch. Keep the context consistent and evolving.

Start by giving me the first complete snapshot of the current repo.
