I have a JavaScript/React web app that connects to a database and lets the user enter SQL queries in a textbox. 
Right now, it executes the query and shows the results in a plain HTML table. 

I want to extend this app by adding data visualizations as part of Phase 1. 
Here is what I need you to do:

1. Keep the existing SQL input box and execution logic.
2. After the SQL query executes, I want to show the results in two ways:
   a) As a table (like it is now).
   b) As a chart visualization.

3. Add a dropdown or tabs that let the user select the chart type:
   - Table (default)
   - Bar chart
   - Line chart
   - Pie chart

4. Use a free JavaScript charting library, preferably **Recharts** (React-based) or **Chart.js**. 
   The chart should automatically adapt to the query result:
   - If there are categorical values with counts, make a bar or pie chart.
   - If there are time-series values, make a line chart.
   - Otherwise fall back to table view.

5. Implement a reusable `Visualization` component that accepts query results as JSON 
   and renders either a table or chart based on the dropdown selection.

6. Keep the styling clean, use a light theme with blue accents (matching medical dashboard look).
7. Make sure everything works with dummy data first, then I will connect it to the live SQL backend.

Please generate:
- A React component for the visualization
- Updated main app code integrating this component
- Any required config or imports for Chart.js/Recharts
