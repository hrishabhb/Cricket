## SLIDE 1: The Problem – Time-Critical Insights Are Stuck
**[Duration: ~90 seconds]**
**[Visual: Problem statement slide. Look directly at camera for opening.]**

Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to share an idea with you today that could transform how healthcare professionals access critical data at IQVIA.

Let me start with a question: **How long should it take to get a critical piece of data that could impact a patient's care?**

Hours? Days? What if I told you that today, at IQVIA, the answer is often **two to three quarters**—six to nine months—for healthcare professionals to access insights from data that already exists in our systems.

This isn't a technology problem. We have sophisticated databases, robust infrastructure, and mountains of valuable data. The problem is **the barrier between the clinical question and the answer**.

When healthcare professionals need insights to make time-sensitive decisions, that data might as well be locked in a vault. And that gap—between having data and actually using it—is costing us opportunities, limiting our impact, and frustrating the very people we're here to serve.

## SLIDE 2: The Story: Dr. Chen
**[Duration: ~90 seconds]**
**[Visual: Dr. Chen story slide. Speak with emotion and pacing for impact.]**

Let me paint a picture of what this looks like in the real world.

It's Tuesday morning, 9:47 AM. Dr. Sarah Chen, an oncologist at one of our partner hospitals, is reviewing a patient's treatment plan. She needs to see outcomes for similar cases—lung cancer patients in California from the last year with comparable staging. This data exists in our system. She knows it does.

So what does she do? She writes an email to IQVIA: *"Hi, I need to pull some case data for a treatment decision..."*

That email goes to hospital management for review. If approved, it's forwarded to the associated registry organization—ACS, AHA, or similar. They evaluate whether it's a legitimate request and if they're seeing similar needs. Then, if everything aligns, it finally reaches IQVIA.

**Timeline: Two to three quarters.**

For a treatment decision that needs to be made... **this week**.

So Dr. Chen makes her best clinical judgment based on memory, general guidelines, and whatever limited data she can access quickly. The insights she needs? They're sitting in our database—just out of reach.

**This is the reality in healthcare—and at IQVIA—every single day.**

## SLIDE 3: The Idea – Meet VitalsIQ
**[Duration: ~2 minutes]**
**[Visual: VitalsIQ logo/concept slide. Energy shift - move from problem to solution.]**

So here's our idea: **What if Dr. Chen could just... ask?**

**[Pause for 2 seconds - let the question land]**

What if, instead of emailing our tech team and waiting months, she could simply type:

> *"Show me lung cancer patient outcomes in California from the last year with stage 3 diagnosis"*

And in **seconds**—not days, not months—she gets a beautiful, interactive visualization with the exact answer she needs?

**That's VitalsIQ.**

VitalsIQ is our proposed **AI-powered self-service reporting tool** that transforms natural language questions into executable database queries—and brings results back instantly in the form of visualizations.

Think of it as **giving every healthcare professional a personal data assistant that speaks their language.**

No SQL required. No technical training. No waiting. Just questions... and answers.

## SLIDE 4: How It Works
**[Duration: ~2 minutes]**
**[Visual: Process diagram or step-by-step animation. Consider screen recording demo if available.]**

Let me walk you through how VitalsIQ would work in practice.

**Step 1:** A hospital administrator types their question in plain English:
> *"How many lung cancer patients were reported by California facilities in 2024?"*

**Step 2:** Behind the scenes, our AI engine—powered by Azure OpenAI—would:
- Understand the intent of their question
- Map it to our database structure
- Generate secure, validated SQL

**Step 3:** The system executes the query safely—read-only access, fully validated, zero risk to data integrity.

**Step 4:** Results appear instantly in both table format and interactive charts—automatically selected based on the type of data returned.

**Total time: Under 3 seconds.**

From question to answer. From confusion to clarity. From waiting to **winning**.

## SLIDE 6: Innovation: Context-Aware AI
**[Duration: ~2 minutes]**
**[Visual: Technical differentiation slide. Show confidence in technical approach.]**

Now, you might be thinking: *"AI query tools already exist. What makes VitalsIQ different?"*

Great question. And here's the answer: **context.**

Most AI query tools fail because they don't understand **your specific data**. They generate generic SQL that doesn't work with your schema, your business rules, your domain terminology. They're built for general databases, not for complex healthcare registry systems.

**VitalsIQ is different.**

We're proposing a **Context-Aware AI system** that:

**1. Learns your database structure** – Understanding tables, relationships, data types, and constraints

**2. Adapts to your domain** – Recognizing healthcare terminology, registry-specific concepts, and clinical language

**3. Validates intelligently** – Ensuring queries are not only syntactically correct but also semantically meaningful

The goal? **95%+ accuracy on natural language queries from day one.**

This isn't about teaching the AI generic SQL. It's about teaching it to think like a healthcare data expert who knows our systems inside and out.

**And this is achievable:**
- ✅ Proven technologies—all components are mature and enterprise-ready  
- ✅ Clear architecture—well-defined three-tier design  
- ✅ Technical expertise—our team has deep experience with these systems  
- ✅ Risk mitigation—multiple validation layers and security checkpoints  

This isn't science fiction. This is achievable with today's technology.

## SLIDE 8: Timeline
**[Duration: ~90 seconds]**
**[Visual: Timeline graphic or Gantt chart showing POC phase.]**

We're proposing a focused, achievable timeline for proof of concept:

**📅 Proof of Concept Phase**  
**Duration:** October 27 – November 19 *(approximately 3-4 weeks)*

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Basic natural language to SQL conversion engine
- ✅ Connection to test database environment
- ✅ Simple visualization suite (table view + basic chart types)
- ✅ Security validation framework
- ✅ 5-10 test queries demonstrating feasibility

**Success Criteria:**
- AI generates valid SQL for **80%+ of test questions**
- **Sub-5-second response time** for typical queries
- **Zero security vulnerabilities** identified in testing
- **Positive stakeholder feedback** from 3-5 domain expert reviews

This is a realistic, achievable timeline that would give us concrete proof that VitalsIQ can deliver on its promise—without requiring massive upfront investment.

## SLIDE 9: Scalability and Cost
**[Duration: ~2 minutes]**
**[Visual: Cost breakdown chart and scaling diagram.]**

Finally, let's talk about the practical realities: **Can this scale? What will it cost?**

**Scalability Strategy:**

**Subscription model** – Per-user subscriptions with monthly request limits (e.g., 200 requests per user per month)

**Capacity planning** – We size Azure OpenAI capacity based on aggregated subscription quotas, ensuring we have the throughput we need

**Azure scaling** – Using provisioned throughput tiers with autoscaling based on rolling 7-day and 30-day usage patterns

**Application autoscaling** – API servers scale automatically; queue systems and backoff mechanisms smooth out usage spikes

**Proactive monitoring** – Tracking requests, tokens, and latency; alerts trigger at >80% utilization to allow capacity increases before users experience degradation

**Cost Estimate:**

Let me give you quick math based on realistic assumptions:

- **User base:** 1,000 users × 200 requests/user/month = **200,000 requests/month**
- **Token usage:** Assuming 1,500 tokens per request on average
- **Total monthly tokens:** 300 million tokens
- **Azure OpenAI cost:** At $0.002 per 1K tokens = **~$600/month**

That's for the AI component alone—highly scalable, highly predictable. Infrastructure costs would add moderately but remain proportional to usage.

**Bottom line:** VitalsIQ is designed to scale efficiently with demand while maintaining predictable costs.
